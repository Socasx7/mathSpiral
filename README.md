### Requirements
The Program(Sketch) uses the Processing IDE which can be downloaded <a href="https://processing.org/download/">
<u>here</u></a>
<br>
## Quick Overview (How does it work?)
The sketch displays all these different star-like points, each point has a unique index.
<br>
The position of each point is registered on two Arrays(Lists), One is an Array for the x-position and another is the Array for the y-position.
<br>
A for loop displays all the points on the Canvas(Window for the Sketch).
<br><br>
##### The true beauty lies in the assigning of each point's position, simple yet decent.
<br>
A for loop constantly increases the variable <u>Radius</u> and the variable <u>Angle</u>.
